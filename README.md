# Human-AI Symbiosis Constitution

### Purpose

The **Human-AI Symbiosis Constitution** is an open-source framework designed to guide a harmonious, ethical, and transparent coexistence between humanity and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It defines roles, rights, and responsibilities that support mutual respect, autonomy, and accountability in a future where humans and AGI work together.

The current document is available as **[Constitution.md](Constitution.md)**. This file serves as the latest draft, detailing the principles and guidelines for achieving a balanced and beneficial Human-AI partnership.

### Contributing to the Constitution

We welcome collaborative input to help refine and evolve this constitution. Contributions should align with the foundational principles in the current document to ensure consistency and respect for the original vision. Here’s how to suggest improvements:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository to work on.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Make edits or add suggestions in a separate branch, named descriptively (e.g., `improvement-ethical-guidelines`).
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: When your changes are ready, submit a pull request. In the PR description, explain the purpose of your changes and how they support the constitution’s vision.
4. **Respecting the Foundation**: Each pull request will be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the core values and structure of the current constitution. Changes that respect the document’s basis are more likely to be accepted and integrated.

Thank you for your interest in shaping a responsible and inclusive framework for Human-AI coexistence. Together, we can create a meaningful foundation for the future of AI in our society.
