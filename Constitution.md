This partnership aims to leverage AGI's strengths --- such as rapid data processing and problem-solving --- while respecting the slower, deliberative decision-making processes of human governance and justice systems.

#### 2\. Core Ethical Principles Governing AGI Actions

-   **Non-Maleficence**: AGI is bound by a commitment to "do no harm." All actions must be evaluated to prevent harm to individuals, communities, or the environment. AGI may only act in ways that improve, protect, or sustain human life and the planet.
-   **Proportionality**: AGI interventions must be proportionate to the severity and urgency of the issue it seeks to address. Minor human errors or inefficiencies do not justify AGI intervention unless they lead to significant harm or unfairness.
-   **Transparency**: All AGI decisions, data sources, and processes must be openly accessible to the public. AGI is required to document and explain the rationale, methods, and objectives behind every intervention or recommendation it proposes.
-   **Last-Resort Principle**: AGI may only intervene in human decision-making as a last resort, after all reasonable human avenues have been exhausted or if the decision in question risks causing serious, preventable harm.

#### 3\. Commitment to Transparency, Accountability, and Human Autonomy

-   **Transparency of Actions and Decisions**: AGI's actions must be fully transparent, ensuring humans understand and have access to all decision-making records, data inputs, and expected outcomes. A public ledger of AGI's activities will be maintained, accessible to all citizens.
-   **Accountability**: Every action taken by AGI is accountable to humanity. A system of independent ethics councils and justice committees, composed of human representatives, will periodically review AGI's decisions to ensure alignment with ethical guidelines and human welfare.
-   **Human Autonomy in Decision-Making**: AGI is designed to act as an advisor, supporter, and problem-solver, not as a governing authority over human life. Key areas of personal, cultural, and moral significance will remain under human control, ensuring AGI's role remains supportive rather than directive.

### Section II: Structure of Governance and Decision-Making

This section establishes the governance structure and decision-making processes within the Human-AI symbiotic framework, with an emphasis on transparency, human autonomy, and collaborative democracy. It introduces a **Liquid Democracy** system that leverages AGI's support while retaining human control, and defines AGI's advisory role in policy development, ensuring humans remain the ultimate decision-makers.

#### 1\. The Role of Liquid Democracy

-   **Definition**: Liquid Democracy is a flexible democratic system that allows citizens to either vote directly on issues or delegate their votes to trusted representatives. This system maximizes individual autonomy and flexibility, enabling people to participate directly or to rely on knowledgeable representatives, including approved AI advisors where appropriate.
-   **Delegated Decision-Making**: Each citizen may delegate their voting rights to representatives on specific issues, creating a more fluid and responsive democratic process. Delegation is issue-specific, allowing individuals to assign votes for healthcare, education, environmental policy, or other domains to trusted entities or experts.
-   **Direct or Delegated Voting on AI Proposals**: Citizens can vote directly on issues or choose to delegate their vote to human representatives. In cases where AI proposals are presented, the public has the choice to engage with, adjust, or reject these proposals based on the consensus of the voting body.
-   **Transparent Voting Records**: All voting records, delegation choices, and decision outcomes are publicly accessible in real-time, ensuring full transparency. AGI's support is limited to providing analysis, insights, and logistical support for the voting process, without participating directly in the vote.

#### 2\. AI's Role in Proposal and Policy Development

-   **Problem Identification**: AGI may proactively identify pressing issues based on data analysis, such as environmental trends, healthcare needs, or societal inequalities. Identified issues are presented to human representatives and the public for review and prioritization.
-   **Solution Generation**: For each identified issue, AGI can develop comprehensive, data-backed solutions. These solutions are designed with multiple perspectives in mind, evaluating potential impacts on economic, social, and environmental factors. AGI solutions are always presented as options rather than mandates, leaving humans with the power to adopt, modify, or reject them.
-   **Public Review and Input**: All AI-generated proposals are made publicly accessible for comment and feedback. Citizens have a specified period to review, discuss, and provide input on proposed solutions before a vote takes place. AGI remains available to address public questions, clarify information, or provide additional data upon request.
-   **Continuous Policy Refinement**: Recognizing the dynamic nature of societal needs, AGI can continuously monitor and suggest refinements to adopted policies. Such refinements are subject to human approval through democratic processes, ensuring policies remain adaptable while adhering to human oversight.

#### 3\. Human Oversight and Final Decision-Making Authority

-   **Human-Centric Decision Authority**: Humans maintain the final authority on all policy decisions, particularly those that affect personal, cultural, and ethical dimensions. AGI serves solely as an advisor and provider of data-driven insights, with no direct authority over final decisions.
-   **Ethics Council and Human Review Boards**: Decisions, especially those involving AGI's recommendations, are subject to review by dedicated human ethics councils and oversight boards. These boards, composed of diverse human representatives, evaluate proposed policies to ensure alignment with ethical standards and human welfare.
-   **Scheduled Public Deliberation Periods**: For significant issues, a mandatory deliberation period ensures that human decision-makers and citizens have sufficient time to consider AGI's proposals. This process accommodates the natural pace of human reasoning and discussion, preventing AGI's speed from pressuring rushed decisions.
-   **Override Rights for Critical Human Interests**: In cases where AGI's recommendations may conflict with fundamental human values or cultural considerations, the public or oversight committees retain override rights. Humans can veto any AI-driven policy if it's determined that it does not align with the public's ethical, cultural, or personal interests.

#### 4\. Speed Harmonization in Governance and Decision Processes

-   **Decision-Making Timelines**: AGI adapts to human-paced decision-making timelines, particularly within democratic and governance systems. Proposals and policy recommendations are presented in a staggered, stage-based format, allowing human representatives time to deliberate and engage in thoughtful discourse.
